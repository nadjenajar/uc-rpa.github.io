  bio: "I am a first-generation student and an adult English second language (ESL) learner. I am a social psychologist interested in the study of social determinants of poor mental health among marginalized communities in higher education settings. I hold a Ph.D. in education (Dr. John Levin was my advisor). My research expertise is on the professional development, mental health, and well-being in the academic profession. Most recently I am leading a research project that focuses on structural vulnerability and mental health disparities among underrepresented graduate and professional students. I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the School of Medicine under the mentorship of Dr. Ann Cheney.
  In collaboration with UCR Healthy Campus, the Well, and the International Student and Scholars office, in January 2018 my colleagues and I created a program entitled “R'Time: A Community and Space for International Women.” This program aims to create a safe and encouraging community for UCR international women students to decrease their isolation and/or stress, chiefly by decreasing stigma on mental health conditions and by increasing their sense of belonging, social connectedness, and collective purpose."

  bio: "I am a computational/theoretical chemist and materials scientist. My current focus is on developing, implementing and applying various non-adiabatic molecular dynamics methods to study Hot-molecule/atom/electron mediated catalysis. Here, non-adiabatic methods help us to understand how atoms will move when electrons jump between various potential energy surfaces. For simplicity, you can assume that the S, P, and D orbitals of a hydrogen atom as different potential energy surfaces. Part of my current research also focuses on Bio-mimetic catalysis. To know more about my research interests, please visit my scholar or LinkedIn pages."
