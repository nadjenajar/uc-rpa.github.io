  bio: "I am a first-generation student and an adult English second language (ESL) learner. I am a social psychologist interested in the study of social determinants of poor mental health among marginalized communities in higher education settings. I hold a Ph.D. in education (Dr. John Levin was my advisor). My research expertise is on the professional development, mental health, and well-being in the academic profession. Most recently I am leading a research project that focuses on structural vulnerability and mental health disparities among underrepresented graduate and professional students. I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the School of Medicine under the mentorship of Dr. Ann Cheney.
  In collaboration with UCR Healthy Campus, the Well, and the International Student and Scholars office, in January 2018 my colleagues and I created a program entitled “R'Time: A Community and Space for International Women.” This program aims to create a safe and encouraging community for UCR international women students to decrease their isolation and/or stress, chiefly by decreasing stigma on mental health conditions and by increasing their sense of belonging, social connectedness, and collective purpose."

  title: "Entomology"
  bio: "I am the first generation in my family to pursue and earn a degree in higher education. I earned my M.S and Ph.D. from the University of Arizona. My current research interests focus on the function of insect steroid hormone importers. Steroid hormones are a group of lipophilic hormones that mediate many biological processes such as growth and development in insects, sexual maturation, immunity and cancer progression in humans. Steroid hormones are produced by endocrine glands and must enter cells by simple diffusion to regulate diverse physiological processes through intracellular nuclear receptors. I am working to characterize the function(s) of the Ecdysone importer in mosquitoes and other insect vector-borne diseases."

After high school, she attended UC San Diego to obtain a BS in Biochemistry, Cell Biology. While at UCSD, Ying was a part of the McNair Scholars program which supports students interested in obtaining a PhD. She did her PhD with Dr. José Dinneny at Stanford University to study plants that live in extreme environments. At Riverside, Ying is co-advised by Sue Wessler and Jason Stajich to understand the impact of transposable elements in rice. Ying enjoys volunteering, baking, playing with animals, dancing, any outdoor activity, ice skating, and watching TV! She believes in mentorship and advocates for inclusion, equity, diversifying academia and solidarity. She hopes to promote the mindset of having gratitude, respect, and love toward one another in academia."

  title: "Entomology"
  bio: "I am of the first generation in my family to achieve graduate education and an academic career. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of São Paulo in Brazil, studying the population dynamics of orchid bees in different areas in the Atlantic Forest. I am an expert in molecular biology and have worked with bees for over 10 years, with additional experience in developmental biology. In 2018, I joined Prof Hollis Woodard lab at UCR and started to study the mechanisms controlling larval development and ultimate body size, which are crucial for the organization of bumblebee societies. My current research focuses on understanding how early development influences the quality of workers and their pollination services. As a Black Woman Scientist, it is my ultimate goal to be a researcher that creates an environment that dually engages and supports other students and researchers from diverse backgrounds. Outside academic life, I love to travel, I love to dance, and I love photographs."
