  bio: "I am a first-generation student and an adult English second language (ESL) learner. I am a social psychologist interested in the study of social determinants of poor mental health among marginalized communities in higher education settings. I hold a Ph.D. in education (Dr. John Levin was my advisor). My research expertise is on the professional development, mental health, and well-being in the academic profession. Most recently I am leading a research project that focuses on structural vulnerability and mental health disparities among underrepresented graduate and professional students. I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at the School of Medicine under the mentorship of Dr. Ann Cheney.
  In collaboration with UCR Healthy Campus, the Well, and the International Student and Scholars office, in January 2018 my colleagues and I created a program entitled “R'Time: A Community and Space for International Women.” This program aims to create a safe and encouraging community for UCR international women students to decrease their isolation and/or stress, chiefly by decreasing stigma on mental health conditions and by increasing their sense of belonging, social connectedness, and collective purpose."

  title: "Entomology, Cambodia/United States"
  bio: "I am the first generation in my family to pursue and earn a degree in higher education. I earned my M.S and Ph.D. from the University of Arizona. My current research interests focus on the function of insect steroid hormone importers. Steroid hormones are a group of lipophilic hormones that mediate many biological processes such as growth and development in insects, sexual maturation, immunity and cancer progression in humans. Steroid hormones are produced by endocrine glands and must enter cells by simple diffusion to regulate diverse physiological processes through intracellular nuclear receptors. I am working to characterize the function(s) of the Ecdysone importer in mosquitoes and other insect vector-borne diseases."
