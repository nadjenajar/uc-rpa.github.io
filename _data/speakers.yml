  bio: "I am a computational/theoretical chemist and materials scientist. My current focus is on developing, implementing and applying various non-adiabatic molecular dynamics methods to study Hot-molecule/atom/electron mediated catalysis. Here, non-adiabatic methods help us to understand how atoms will move when electrons jump between various potential energy surfaces. For simplicity, you can assume that the S, P, and D orbitals of a hydrogen atom as different potential energy surfaces. Part of my current research also focuses on Bio-mimetic catalysis. To know more about my research interests, please visit my scholar or LinkedIn pages."
